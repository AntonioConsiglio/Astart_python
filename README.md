## A* PyGame PathFinder
This is an easy visual representation of the algorithm A* for path finding.

What is possible to do with this:

- Generate a visual map with random obstacles (The default probability that a block is an obstacle is 15%).
- Change a block from walkable to an obstacle and vice versa with a left mouse click on the block in the map.
- Use a right click to select the start block and the target block. Once the two are set, click "FIND" to start the algorithm for the best path search. It's possible to observe the step-by-step search by adjusting the sleep parameter in the "config.py" file.
- After the search, you can clear the map using the "CLEAR" button and conduct another test.
