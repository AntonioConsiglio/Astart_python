## Intro
This is an easy visual representation of the algorithm A* for path finding.

What is possible to do with that:

- Generate a visual map with random obstacle (The probability that a block is an obstacle is 15% default)
- It is possible to change a block from walkable to obstacle and viceversa with the left mouse click on the block in the map
- With the right click is it possible to select the start block and the target block, Once the two are settet click "FIND" to 
    make the algorithm start the best path search. Is it possible to see step-by-step search changing the sleep parameter in config file.
- After the search, you can cleen the map using the "CLEAR" button, and make another test.
